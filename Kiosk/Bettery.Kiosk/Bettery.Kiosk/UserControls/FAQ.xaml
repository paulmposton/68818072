                        <LineBreak />
                        Get new batteries; just $2.50 (regular price) for a 4-pack plus a $5 deposit.  Use your batteries (just the same as you use regular AA or AAA batteries). When your batteries are drained, return them in the case, and swap for freshly charged ones for $2.50 (regular price).  This is way less than the cost of a 4-pack at the grocery store!

                        <LineBreak />
                        We recommend you start with four 4-packs of AA batteries (16 AAs) and two 4-packs of AAA batteries (8 AAAs).  This will provide you with enough to get started and allow for a few handy spares.

                        <LineBreak />
                        BETTERY works to eliminate material, production, energy and chemical waste associated with the manufacturing and disposal of single-use (disposable) alkaline batteries by using rechargeable batteries.  The batteries we provide last as long as premium single-use batteries in most devices, and up to 2 or 3 times longer in high-power devices.  A single BETTERY battery can replace 500  single-use batteries.  With over three billion household batteries consumed each year, using BETTERY batteries can save a lot of waste.

                        BETTERY is committed to making a difference in the environment, and to do that we offer alkaline battery recycling at no charge to you.  The alkaline batteries you return are recycled in an environmentally responsible manner right here by a leading Pacific Northwest recycling company, Total Reclaim.
If you have a large quantity of batteries, or the household batteries other than AA, AAA, C or D alkaline batteries, please bring them to a frequently scheduled BETTERY recycling event.
